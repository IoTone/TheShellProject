# Overview 

This section contains all the documentation regarding The Shell Project.

The documentation is structured in the following sections :

* [Developer Convention](github.com/IoTone/TheShellProject/documentation/DEVELOPER_CONVENTION.md) - Some common conventions used by D programmers and developers, or, the so called "D way", is put here to guide newcomers (even new D programmers can benefit from this, we think).

* [Project Design](github.com/IoTone/TheShellProject/documentation/PROJECT_DESIGN.md) - This is a preparation for the future technical white paper, containing all the necessary steps (libraries, algorithms, materials and references) to make The Shell Project take off.
