# Overview 

This section contains all the documentation regarding The Shell Project.

The documentation is structured in the following sections :

### Developer Convention 

Some common conventions used by D programmers and developers, or, the so called "D way", is put here to guide newcomers (even new D programmers can benefit from this, we think).

### Project Design

 This is a preparation for the future technical white paper, containing all the necessary steps (libraries, algorithms, materials and references) to make The Shell Project take off.

 #### Project Status (directory)

 Every phase of the project we put in separate documents, describing everything we've accomplished, as well all issues and dificulties.
