# Overview

As every language is made for solving practical problems, or represent formal structure of the outside world in a computational context manner, D has it's pros and cons, providing capabilities for accomplishing variated tasks in simple and complex computer programs and systems, as described in the section [Areas of usage](https://dlang.org/areas-of-d-usage.html) in Dlang website.

The sections below enlights the main muscles that D has to offer to this project :

### Design by Contract

Contracts are the concept of preconditions and postconditions for function calls, and invariants for data types. Contracts are yet another way of allowing an application correctly achieve its purpose.

### Template programming

Notes...

### Metaprogramming

Notes...

### Fast compilation

Notes...

### Good readability

Notes...

### Code efficiency

Everyone wants efficiency in whatever they do, at least comprising people who cares about the impact of their work. Programmers and engineers, as almost all those involved in IT or general technology field, appreciate efficiency in a way a lot of effort can be saved, letting them to redirect wasted time to other tasks

### Multiple platforms at once

Notes...

This undoubtly extends the potential of a general purpose blockchain to not only multiple platforms but other device types, providing a fertile field to explore Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios into the blockchain ecosystem, and possibly find other use cases in other industries and academic research.
