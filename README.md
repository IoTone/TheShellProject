# Overview

The Shell Project: The Shell Project (working name) aims to build a viable general purpose blockchain, with attributes of security, ease of deployment, clear specification, ease of use for DAPPs, and multiple implementation interop.  Since the focus is on generalized use cases, not specifically cryptocurrency, it becomes possible for others to adapt this to their own use cases.  The goal is to keep this project pure OSS, although it is associated with a business entity.  We don't care who uses it, forks it, distributes it.  And we don't intend to file patents on anything that has the intent of requiring commercial licensing or targetted patent trolling.  The first implemetnation would be in Dlang.  We will be working with another developer to ensure at least one other blockchain implementation is built in Java.

## Why create The Shell Project

Why not

### Why not fork Bitcoin?

Bitcoin has addressed the mainstream view for cryptocurrencies and large use of blockchain technology, demonstrating great potential for market change such as new ways to generate and manage digital assets. However, problems involving limitations in scalability and performance with the PoW (Proof-of-Work) such as security had lead to new implementations of Bitcoin and newer approaches. In the Shell Project we aim to work side by side with Bitcoin as matter of keeping up all the blocks generated since when Bitcoin was launched.

## Use Cases

Tons of great use cases here: https://medium.com/swlh/blockchain-benefits-use-cases-d259c823e968


## Design

From Pedro:
1. Simple block generation and verification;
2. Node addition and recognizing;
3. Simple consensus of which operations was really performed into the blocks:
4. Shared state of hashed blocks;
5. Node health checking and consensus exposition;
6. Consensus achievement and possible "race conditions" that could be envolved
7. Design of simple business logics that could be run into the transaction blocks

## TODO

- Initial commits
- Project plan
- A white paper
- Perform experimental (but very simple) transactions to validate the prototype
- Find some additional contributors
